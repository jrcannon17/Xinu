OS Assignment 2

* Disclaimer Note 1 
Before I answer any questions, there is a problem much bigger than the original problem asked. When the command ‘make’ is  ran, the following error is displayed:

*Disclaimer Note 2:
Problem was fixed. In the apps folder, there was a duplicate of the produce and consume functions. Deleted skeletons and replaced with ones already made. I have left the answers the same because I believe after running prodcons, they were pretty accurate already.

I have asked THREE students and even had someone show me their code outline (not the body), which I dearly appreciate. These students will be mentioned in the collaborators section not because they helped code any of the assignment, but solely because we tried our best efforst to crack this problem. We do not think there is an error in the body of the code itself, but rather it has something to do with declaring the consumer/producer functions and actually defining them. I believe the problem lies in Xinu running the function before it is considering it a prototype as the error might imply. Then again, being new to all of this, C included, I could be completely wrong. This is EXTREMELY frustrating and I will do my best to solve this problem tomorrow, but I am submitting it tonight to get what credit I can on it. Hopefully, I can get partial credit if I do find the problem.

1. Does Program output any garbage?

- I believe it would if it ran due to this process not being synced in any kind of way. That is only a guess based on what we’ve learned thus far in the class. I will update this when the code actually is able to run. 

2. Are produced values getting consumed? Check with low number like 20.

- I think some would, but not all no matter what the value is. I think produce and consume might run one after the other, causing some conflict. 

3. Function explanation (please excuse the messy code. Will get better with practice.)
Producer
Takes n and creates a produced value based on count, starting from 0
Consumer
Takes n and breaks it down as the consumer, again starting from 0 
Xsh_prodcons.c
Primary objective of this program is to ready the producer and consumer functions in the queue. Also checks the validation of args*. A isNumeric function verifies if the argument is truly numeric or not. Either way, the atoi 
library function converts the string into an integer regardless if the isNUmeric reads TRUE.
